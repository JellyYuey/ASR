# Instructions for Running
1. In the terminal, enter:
   ```
   myvenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   to activate the virtual environment. If the command line shows `(myvenv)` at the beginning, it means the virtual environment has been successfully activated.
2. In the terminal, enter `python compare_MFCC.py` to run the main program.
3. You can open the source file `compare_MFCC.py` and modify the name of the audio file on line `150` to view the heatmap comparison results for MFCC feature extraction on different audio files.
4. The `recording_files` folder in this directory provides three types of audio recordings: clear speech, noisy speech, and short speech. You can also add other types of audio files for comparison.
